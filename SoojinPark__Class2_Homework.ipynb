And we often have to sort out files in particular ways so that we can make a separate list to indicate that they are files that serve a particular purpose (for example: I might want to distinguish document files that contain the metadata for an original file vs a mezzanine copy.) So I thought it would be helpful to have Python extract a list of files from a directory that contains a particular word. I'm only aware of the functions in Excel that allows you to sort out names via the letters that the file starts/ends with. But often times, the words I'm looking for are placed in the middle of the file name. So I wanted to create a script that would simply list files with a particular string in them\n",

        "Input/Output: As you can see from the script I made below, I used the 'import' and '.listdir' statements to bring the names of the files that I want to work with. I also used the 'for-in' loop \"to traverse sequentially through lists, tuples, strings, dictionary, and sets\" as found through my research. And as we went over in class, I used 'if...in' to find the items that contain the word 'original' (set as variable 'keyword'). \n",
